Renting Services for travellers

### Problem Statement:
 While finding a perfect set of travelling essentials/equipment , tourists have to go through a lot of hassle finding the stores in a new place for required items of suitable quality. They end up buying unnecessary things but they need it for single use.

### Description: 
Travlease connects the tourists with the local service providers and allow them to rent such items before their trips. They only have to pre-book the equipment from the website. 
Also since tourists don't necessarily have to buy items or carry them from their homes they can use this web app, they can enjoy the trip more instead of worrying about availability of required equipment(s).
